## Abstract

*Allomaieta pterocalycina*, a new species registered for the department of Antioquia, Colombia is described and illustrated. It differs from other species of the genus by the presence of winged-like conspicuous projections in both the hypanthium and calyptra. This new taxon grows in ombrophilous environments, inside well-preserved forest remnants, between 400 and 700 m asl. Due to its limited distribution, habitat specificity, surrounding forest fragmentation and degree of threat of its occurrence area, the category “Critically Endangered” (CR) is suggested.
