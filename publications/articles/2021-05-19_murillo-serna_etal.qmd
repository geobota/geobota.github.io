## Abstract

A new species of Melastomataceae from the Andes of Colombia is described and illustrated. *Miconia lorenaensis* is part of *Miconia* sect. *Amblyarrhena*, and it differs from other species in this group by the combination of branches, petioles and leaves covered by scattered short dendritic trichomes, 7-nerved peltate leaves, acuminate or cuspidate apex with a circinate-thickened tip and flowers with completely inferior, 3-locular ovary. Comments about its distribution, habitat, phenology and taxonomic affinities are provided.
